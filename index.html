  <h1>DESCRIPTION OF THE DISH</h1>
  <p>Nigerian Jollof rice is a vibrant, flavorful West African dish known for its rich, smoky, and spicy taste. It's a one-pot rice dish, traditionally cooked over firewood, which imparts a distinctive smoky flavor, although it can also be made on the stovetop. The dish features long-grain rice cooked in a flavorful tomato-based sauce with a blend of spices, including onions, peppers (like scotch bonnet for heat), and other aromatic herbs. It's often served with fried plantains, meat (like chicken, beef, or goat), or other accompaniments.</p>
